This repository provides a dataset and sampling code to create rare disease patient personas as described in [reference to AIiH paper to be added]. 


The CSV Patient Perspective Data file [patient_perspective_data.csv] consists of the knowledge base with the augmented patient perspective. 

The code to generate individual patient profiles from this knowledge base is provided as a jupyter notebook file [Generating Patient Profiles.ipynb] and as a python file [generating_patient_profiles.py] for convenience (only the prefered format needs to be used).
